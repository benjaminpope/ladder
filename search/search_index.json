To find current supported versions, use this jaxlib \u00b7 PyPI link. They discuss this on the github discussions page: jaxlib removal from pypi \u00b7 Discussion #7608 \u00b7 google/jax \u00b7 GitHub details the removal, and provides basic instructions about how to install depreciated versions. To install old versions first navigate to this website and find the relvelant version. Note the cuda versions include GPU support, while the nocuda version is the standard version. Say we want version 0.1.57, there are multiple distributions: nocuda/jaxlib-0.1.57-cp36-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl nocuda/jaxlib-0.1.57-cp37-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl nocuda/jaxlib-0.1.57-cp38-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl nocuda/jaxlib-0.1.57-cp39-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl Since we don't know which one we have to try all of them. Install to your venv like so: pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/nocuda/jaxlib-0.1.57-cp38-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl cp38 turns out the be the correct version for OSX, with the other versions throwing an error: ERROR: jaxlib-0.1.57-cp39-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform On the github discussion page they also show how to update requirements.txt files to search this google storage drive for the required version. For exmaple this would be how to install the correct jax versions for the present (as of 02/09/2021) stable Morphine distribution # jax --find-links https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html jax==0.1.77 jaxlib==0.1.57","title":"Installing Jax"},{"location":"publishing/","text":"Astronomy Publishing Unlike some sciences, astronomy has a pretty healthy publishing ecosystem, without the same prevalence of predatory journals, paywalls, and high rejection rates. Here are some of the basics on publishing in astronomy. Astrophysics Data System (ADS) You can find almost any paper in astronomy using the powerful search engine ADS , the Astrophysics Data System. There is a lot of cool functionality here! You can search by first author, other authors, year, words in the title or abstract - but also remember to create libraries (eg this one of all my papers) to help organize things. The number one use case is finding papers - and the number two is creating BibTeX citation refs to go in your papers. arXiv For two decades now, nearly all physics and astronomy papers (and an increasing range of other sciences) have been uploaded to arXiv , and for astronomy in particular, to the subsection of arXiv called astro-ph . They are all free to access, from anywhere you are, and typically linked to ADS pages with all the metadata you would ever want. There are six subsections of astro-ph for different subject areas; three are directly relevant to my research, and I usually check the new round of papers every weekday at 2pm Brisbane time for astro-ph.EP - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics , astro-ph.IM - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics , and astro-ph.SR - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics . Journals The first point is you'll probably rarely read journals - you'll find papers through ADS or arXiv! Most astronomy papers are handled in one of three sets of journals, more by geographic origin of the researchers than anything else. The American Astronomical Society publish AAS journals such as The Astrophysical Journal ; the British Royal Astronomical Society publish Monthly Notices or MNRAS; and the European Southern Observatory have Astronomy & Astrophysics or A&A. These all have subsidiaries including Letters for short high impact papers, or Supplements for big data releases, et cetera. I tend to publish in ApJ or sometimes MNRAS. All three have basically quite high acceptance rates; you're unlikey to get a decent paper rejected, but peer reviewers will rigorously ask for detail and revisions. Prestige journals like Nature , Nature Astronomy and Science do have higher-profile results, correspondingly high rejection rates, and sometimes the results can be too good to be true! There are also regional journals, often dedicated to observatories, such as Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia or PASA, and an American journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific or PASP with a big emphasis on methods. We will be doing a lot of software development, and the Journal of Open Source Software is a great place to submit short papers documenting the cool open source software tools we make. Hardware papers are often in SPIE , which is the exception to all the above rules and can be paywalled or hard to access, or in JATIS . We also do interdisciplinary work, and my favourite journal for this is Proceedings of the Royal Society A , who publish lots of really cool applied mathematics and physics.","title":"Publishing in Astronomy"},{"location":"publishing/#astronomy-publishing","text":"Unlike some sciences, astronomy has a pretty healthy publishing ecosystem, without the same prevalence of predatory journals, paywalls, and high rejection rates.

While you get up to speed on astronomy research, it is great to read astrobites to get the gist of the broad sweep of astronomy! They also have more general guides: to (American!) graduate school , and to astrophyics software . astrobetter There is also a great page of astronomy tutorials and general advice at astrobetter , covering everything from software to jobs. Statistics We will be using a lot of stats in astronomy! General Statistics My favourite textbooks on statistics are Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms , by Mackay, free online; Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial by Sivia, for which I have a hard copy I can lend you; and Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences by Gregory, for which I also have a hard copy. There is a great series of tutorial papers by David Hogg and members of the NYC stats community on stats for astronomy: On MCMC: Data analysis recipes: Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo , Hogg & Foreman-Mackey On regularized fitting: Fitting very flexible models: Linear regression with large numbers of parameters , Hogg & Villar On Bayesian inference: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data , Hogg, Bovy, & Lang On Probability theory: Data analysis recipes: Probability calculus for inference , Hogg and other papers, like A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo , Betancourt Gaussian Processes The great textbook by Rasmussen & Williams is freely available as a PDF online .

Probably good to have a look at these! Photometry Papers Kernel Phase Papers Radio Stars and Exoplanets Radiocarbon Papers Also... My DPhil thesis! If you can read French, Frantz Martinache's Habilitation thesis has great discussion of kernel phase theory. Astronomy in Australia and The World Satellites might live in a vacuum - but we certainly don't. Here are some reading materials to help get to grips with the complex relationship between astronomy, politics, culture, and power. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein maintains an excellent Decolonizing Science Reading List , which has a particularly deep engagement with issues about the exploitation of Indigenous people and land for telescopes, such as at the summit of Maunakea in Hawai'i. Prescod-Weinstein's book The Disordered Cosmos is available in the UQ library . In the Australian context, it is vital to engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander science. I strongly recommend the Warwick Thornton documentary We Don't Need A Map , the Ray Norris book Emu Dreaming , and the online resources at aboriginalastronomy.com.au . For the history of our our astronomical community, I have a collection of hard copy biographies and memoirs of prominent Australian and international astronomers, which you are welcome to borrow: for instance Australian radio astronomy pioneers Ruby Payne-Scott , John Bolton , Jim Peebles , and Carl Sagan. Astronomy is a very carbon-intensive science and some great work has been done on our climate impacts (which we need to do better at minimizing!). There is an excellent Climate Issue in Nature Astronomy, including especially this article about Australian astronomy's climate impacts (substantially from fossil electricity to run observatories and supercomputing!).","title":"Recommended Reading"},{"location":"reading/#learning-the-background","text":"","title":"Learning the Background"},{"location":"reading/#astrobites","text":"If you want to keep up with the latest research, a good place to start is astrobites , a grad-student-run collective who do amazingly accessible blog posts about recent astronomy papers.
