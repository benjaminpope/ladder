On Windows this is called the Command Prompt. (If you have trouble installing you can also use the Google Colab I will mention later!) Installing Python Most software development will be done in Python, and I recommend using Anaconda to install Python 3 and pip to manage packages. What it does is create its own version of Python that doesn't interfere with your default install, and has 'environments' into which you can install software safely that doesn't interact with software in other environments. There is a great conda cheat sheet with lots of tools to help you use Conda. To install Python on a Mac or Linux machine, I recommend you install Conda from here , and then create and load an environment with important software pre-installed: - pip , which installs other Python packages, - numpy , which is a general-purpose maths library, - astropy , which has lots of functions for astronomy, including how we will load data, and the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram for period determination, - scipy , with miscellaneous scientific python features, and - ipykernel , which runs Jupyter notebooks. conda init conda create --name ladder python=3.9 pip numpy matplotlib astropy scipy ipykernel conda activate ladder Then you can work to your heart's content in this conda environment. Jupyter Notebooks The main way that professional data scientists, physicists, and astronomers interactively use Python is through the Jupyter Notebook environment. This is an interactive, browser-based interpreter for Python. If you install Conda like above, you'll be good to go with the terminal command jupyter notebook . On the other hand, you might like to use Google Colab , a free web-hosted Jupyter notebook environment that works like Google Docs. Try it here ! Git Repositories How do you share code with your colleagues? This is an important skill not just for this course - but anything you do down the track in science, software engineering, or the commercial sector. This doesn't just apply to Python scripts you'll write here, but to any sort of code - including this website. You want to have everything in a repository , which is a remote server in the cloud that has all your software backed up, with saved checkpoints you can go back to if something is wrong. The most popular software for interacting with repositories is git , and there are two big companies that offer comparable cloud storage for your repos: - Atlassian offers BitBucket - Microsoft runs GitHub You can share these codes with your teammates and jointly collaborate on a project. The user interface is a little harder than Google Docs but I recommend you master it - it is a huge transferable skill. All my code is version-controlled github.com/benjaminpope . On my local machine I made a directory /Users/benjaminpope/code/ cd . mkdir code and you can download a repo (like this website as an example!) to your machine like this: cd code git clone https://github.com/benjaminpope/ladder/ cd ladder Making Open-Source Software Christina Hedges (NASA Ames) has a fantastic introduction to open-source software practices for astronomy, in which the above tools and many others are explained, for an audience of ~ PhD students: christinahedges.github.io/astronomy_workflow","title":"Learning Python"},{"location":"software/#software-practices","text":"","title":"Software Practices"},{"location":"software/#the-command-line","text":"You'll want to have access to a computer with a command line interface - on Mac or Linux, this is just going to be via the app Terminal.

Astrophysics Data System (ADS) You can find almost any publication in astronomy using the powerful search engine for papers ADS , the Astrophysics Data System. There is a lot of cool functionality here! You can search by first author, other authors, year, words in the title or abstract - but also remember to create libraries (eg this one of all my papers) to help organize things. The number one use case is finding papers - and the number two is creating BibTeX citation refs to go in your papers. SIMBAD The search engine for stars, SIMBAD , is your friend. Nearly all stars have many identifiers in many different catalogs - how do you know which is which? Search it in SIMBAD, by name, coordinates, or whatever, and you can bring up lots of metadata (including publications that refer to that star). VizieR From the same team that brought you SIMBAD comes VizieR , a tool for manipulating astronomical catalogues and databases. Want to cross-match two surveys? VizieR provides painless ways to do this! MAST The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes archives all NASA space telescope data. You can search all NASA data on MAST using this web interface .
