# values

We are committed to an equitable, inclusive, and supportive research group. 

While we collaboratively develop this page, for the moment the Flatiron Institute astro data group values statement is a good piece to think about: [values.astrodata.nyc](http://values.astrodata.nyc/).

While we work out a detailed collaboration policy, I like [Ruth Angus'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWaVOINUsdvUmcnNl0NWxpiJTcLDVmh2V80ni4o6AaE/edit) and we will basically follow that. The main gist is - my expectation regarding authorship is that the major contributor to a paper should be first author, _especially_ if they are a student. And regarding co-authorship, I would always prefer to be generous and include people.

I wanted to add that I hope to foster a relatively non-hierarchical environment. It is my job to help students and collaborators achieve their goals and grow as researchers, and not to exploit people for their labor! As a result, please do not hesitate to make suggestions or requests regarding pay, funding, proposals, or to raise any problems that might arise.

All research outputs, unless there is a really good reason otherwise, should be made publicly available with public data, open-source software, and publication on arXiv.
