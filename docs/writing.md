# Writing in Astronomy

Writing in astronomy will have some different workflows to other fields - in particular, almost every paper is written in the formatting language LaTeX, rather than (say) Word, and we have to use specialist tools to work with this. It has a bit of a steep learning curve but because it makes it so easy to format citations and equations, it's actually a really helpful part of the workflow.

## LaTeX Guides

There is a good LaTeX guide on [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/2018/01/20/getting-started-with-latex/). 

## Overleaf

People have strong views about LaTeX environments, but my preferred go-to for ease of use is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project), which like Google Docs allows people to collaboratively work on the same document. 

## Writing for the Public

It is really important not just to learn to write papers - a lot of an astronomer's job is actually writing proposals, reviews, lectures, and public engagement material. It is a great idea to practise this! One good place to start is to pitch an idea to [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/apply-to-write-for-astrobites/submit-a-guest-post/) as a guest post. For a more substantial and public facing piece, you might like to pitch to [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/au).
