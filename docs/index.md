Materials to help new students get started in the stars and planets group at UQ!

## Host

Benjamin Pope

## Overview

If you're reading this, welcome! I'm excited to have you joining our group at UQ. 

These (evolving) documents are to help you get to know the people, tools, ideas, and values that will be important in working together on these projects. These are my personal views, and open to discussion and revision. I'm quite junior myself so don't take my advice as gospel! Check out the links on the left to browse the resources.

## The General Idea

This is, insofar as is possible, a non-hierarchical group. I'm not going to tell you what to do! My role is to help you learn as a researcher.

## License

We invite anyone interested to use and modify these startup docs under a MIT license. If you want to add anything, it would be great if you submit a pull request so we can update the page with new materials!
