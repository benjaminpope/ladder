# PHYS3080 Distance Ladder

Materials to help students get started in the PHYS3080 Distance Ladder project at UQ!

## Overview

If you're reading this, welcome! I'm excited to have you in our class.

The Distance Ladder project is a computer lab, in which you'll be expected to do computer-based data analysis of a simulated universe. You can find the project description and data [here](universe).

These (evolving) documents are to help you get to know the tools and ideas that will be important in working together on these projects. Check out the links on the left to browse the resources.

## Software in this Project

For this computer-based project, you'll want to choose a set of software to use for loading, plotting, and analysing the dataset you'll be given. Astronomy research is less about looking through a telescope eyepiece than taking large sets of electronic data and applying sophisticated algorithms to better understand what they tell us - and this is a chance to learn some of the tools and approaches we use in research.

Most astronomers, physicists, and data scientists in academia and the private sector write their software in Python, and this is what we recommend you use here. 

There is a tutorial page on installing Python in this project [here](software), and Python notebooks to show you how to [estimate the distance to a cluster](notebooks/hr_diagram) and figure out a [period-luminosity diagram](notebooks/lombscargle_example/). 

Other popular languages for data analysis in the sciences are [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). If you are familiar with those, you are welcome to use them! It has been common in the past to use the closed-source Matlab, and we have some scripts available [here](matlab). You probably [don't want to use Excel](https://rogerjbarlow.com/2022/02/21/whats-wrong-with-excel/).
